 First: 2server.py ‚Äî the Server code
This code creates a server that waits for messages from clients and joins (concatenates) two strings they send.

Line-by-line explanation:
python
Copy
Edit
#pip install Pyro4   -do this before running this code
This is a comment telling you to install the Pyro4 library first. You do this by typing:

nginx
Copy
Edit
pip install Pyro4
Pyro4 helps different Python programs talk to each other over the network.

python
Copy
Edit
import Pyro4
This line loads the Pyro4 library so we can use its tools in our program.

python
Copy
Edit
@Pyro4.expose
This decorator makes the class below visible to the outside world. In simple terms: it tells Pyro4 that clients will be allowed to use the class.

python
Copy
Edit
class StringConcatenator:
Defines a class (like a blueprint) called StringConcatenator.

python
Copy
Edit
    def concatenate(self, str1, str2):
Inside the class, this function concatenate takes two inputs (str1 and str2).

python
Copy
Edit
        print(f"Received: {str1}, {str2}")
When the server receives the two strings from the client, it prints them for debugging.

python
Copy
Edit
        return str1 + str2
Joins the two strings together and sends them back to the client.

python
Copy
Edit
def start_server():
This is another function, which sets up and starts the server.

python
Copy
Edit
    daemon = Pyro4.Daemon(host="localhost")
Starts the Pyro server, listening only on your own computer (localhost).

python
Copy
Edit
    uri = daemon.register(StringConcatenator)
Registers the StringConcatenator class so Pyro can find it.

It also gives you a uri, like an address, to connect to the server.

python
Copy
Edit
    print("Server running. URI:", uri)
Shows the server's URI on the screen. You‚Äôll need this URI to connect from the client.

python
Copy
Edit
    daemon.requestLoop()
Keeps the server running, waiting for requests from clients.

python
Copy
Edit
start_server()
Calls the function and actually starts the server.

üîπ Second: 2client.py ‚Äî the Client code
This code connects to the server and asks it to join two strings.

Line-by-line explanation:
python
Copy
Edit
import Pyro4
Loads the Pyro4 library again, just like in the server.

python
Copy
Edit
# Paste the URI from the server output
uri = "PYRO:obj_0f7c0de419004721ad557cb1763e60c6@localhost:55273"
This is the address of the server. You get this from the server's output and paste it here.

python
Copy
Edit
proxy = Pyro4.Proxy(uri)
This creates a proxy ‚Äî like a remote controller ‚Äî to talk to the server.

python
Copy
Edit
str1 = input("Enter first string: ")
str2 = input("Enter second string: ")
These two lines ask the user to enter two strings.

python
Copy
Edit
result = proxy.concatenate(str1, str2)
Sends the two strings to the server and tells it: "Please join these."

The server does the work and sends the result back.

python
Copy
Edit
print("Concatenated result:", result)
Prints the result that came from the server.

üîÅ Summary of How It Works:
You run the server ‚Üí it starts listening and shows you a URI.

You copy that URI into the client code.

Run the client ‚Üí it sends strings to the server.

The server joins the strings and sends the result back.

The client prints the final result.



THEORY (Detailed Explanation)
üìå What is this code about?
This is a Python-based Remote Procedure Call (RPC) system using Pyro4 (Python Remote Objects). It allows one Python program (client) to call a method in another Python program (server) running on a different process or even machine.

üìò What is Pyro4?
Pyro4 is a Python library that enables you to build distributed applications. It allows a client program to access Python objects in a remote server as if they were local.

It is based on:

Object-Oriented Programming

Sockets and serialization (done internally)

Remote Method Invocation (RMI) in a Pythonic way.

üîß How It Works (Step-by-Step Explanation)
1. Server Code (2server.py)
It defines a class StringConcatenator with a method concatenate that takes two strings and returns their concatenation.

It registers this class with Pyro4 so that it can be called remotely.

It starts a daemon (server) that runs indefinitely and waits for client requests.

2. Client Code (2client.py)
It uses the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) printed by the server to connect to the remote object.

It takes two string inputs from the user.

It calls the concatenate method remotely using Pyro4 proxy.

It prints the result returned by the server.

3. Communication
Uses inter-process communication via TCP/IP on the localhost.

Pyro4 handles serialization/deserialization (turning Python objects into a format that can be sent over a network).

üìã Key Concepts You Should Know
Concept	Explanation
RPC	Remote Procedure Call ‚Äì calling a function in another program over a network.
Pyro4 Daemon	A server component that listens for client requests.
URI	A unique address to identify the remote object.
Proxy	A local object that behaves like the remote object.
Expose	@Pyro4.expose allows a method/class to be accessed remotely.
Serialization	Converting objects into bytes for transfer over a network.

üß† POSSIBLE EXAM/VIVA QUESTIONS (with answers)
üí¨ Basic Questions
Q: What is Pyro4?

Pyro4 is a library in Python used for building distributed applications. It allows remote method calls between Python objects.

Q: What does @Pyro4.expose do?

It makes the class or method available to be called from the client.

Q: What is a Pyro4 Daemon?

It is a server-side object that listens for incoming client connections and processes remote calls.

Q: What is the purpose of daemon.register()?

It registers a class instance or object so that Pyro can assign it a URI and expose it to clients.

Q: Why do we need a URI in Pyro4?

The URI is the address of the remote object. The client uses it to locate and connect to the server object.

Q: What is a proxy in Pyro4?

It is an object on the client side that acts as if it were the remote object, allowing remote method calls.

Q: Why do we use localhost in the server?

Because we are running both client and server on the same computer for testing purposes.

Q: What happens if you use the wrong URI in the client?

The client will not be able to connect to the server and will raise a connection error.

üí¨ Advanced Questions
Q: How does Pyro4 internally communicate between client and server?

It uses sockets over TCP/IP and automatically serializes Python objects into bytes using pickle.

Q: Can this code work over the internet?

Yes, if you replace localhost with a public IP address and open the firewall/ports appropriately.

Q: How do you handle security in Pyro4?

Pyro4 supports SSL, authentication, and IP whitelisting, but by default, it is insecure and should not be used over untrusted networks without security settings.

Q: What happens if the server is not running and the client tries to connect?

The client will raise a CommunicationError or TimeoutError.

Q: Can you call any method from the server class?

Only methods that are exposed using @Pyro4.expose can be called remotely.
